# @cotep/role-and-task

@cotep/role-and-task is a tool to start multiple Node.js processes and manage theirs tasks. It's an easy way to scale your application 100% offline and to get rid of monothread problem.

The processes and the tasks are linked with each other using a ZeroMQ pipe which allow them to communicate and perform complex work.

Create your tasks, declare them to the library and describe the architecture you want, and that's it!

Example of what you can achieve with it :
