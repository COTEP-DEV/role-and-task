# @cotep/role-and-task

@cotep/role-and-task is a tool to start multiple Node.js processes and manage theirs tasks. It's an easy way to scale your application 100% offline and to get rid of monothread problem.

The processes and the tasks are linked with each other using a ZeroMQ pipe which allow them to communicate and perform complex work.

Create your tasks, declare them to the library and describe the architecture you want, and that's it!

### Installation

> npm install --save @cotep/role-and-task
